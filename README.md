### Containerized Installation

Use docker to deploy ERPAdda in production or for development of [VMRaid](https://github.com/vmraid/vmraid) apps. See https://github.com/vmraid/vmraid_docker for more details.

### Full Install

The Easy Way: our install script for chair will install all dependencies (e.g. MariaDB). See https://github.com/vmraid/chair for more details.

New passwords will be created for the ERPAdda "Administrator" user, the MariaDB root user, and the vmraid user (the script displays the passwords and saves them to ~/vmraid_passwords.txt).

## Logo and Trademark

The brand name ERPAdda and the logo are trademarks of VMRaid

### Introduction

VMRaid (VMRaid) owns and oversees the trademarks for the ERPAdda name and logos. We have developed this trademark usage policy with the following goals in mind:

- We’d like to make it easy for anyone to use the ERPAdda name or logo for community-oriented efforts that help spread and improve ERPAdda.
- We’d like to make it clear how ERPAdda-related businesses and projects can (and cannot) use the ERPAdda name and logo.
- We’d like to make it hard for anyone to use the ERPAdda name and logo to unfairly profit from, trick or confuse people who are looking for official ERPAdda resources.

### VMRaid Usage Policy

Permission from VMRaid is required to use the ERPAdda name or logo as part of any project, product, service, domain or company name.

We will grant permission to use the ERPAdda name and logo for projects that meet the following criteria:

- The primary purpose of your project is to promote the spread and improvement of the ERPAdda software.
- Your project is non-commercial in nature (it can make money to cover its costs or contribute to non-profit entities, but it cannot be run as a for-profit project or business).
Your project neither promotes nor is associated with entities that currently fail to comply with the GPL license under which ERPAdda is distributed.
- If your project meets these criteria, you will be permitted to use the ERPAdda name and logo to promote your project in any way you see fit with one exception: Please do not use ERPAdda as part of a domain name.

Use of the ERPAdda name and logo is additionally allowed in the following situations:

All other ERPAdda-related businesses or projects can use the ERPAdda name and logo to refer to and explain their services, but they cannot use them as part of a product, project, service, domain, or company name and they cannot use them in any way that suggests an affiliation with or endorsement by ERPAdda or VMRaid Technologies or the ERPAdda open source project. For example, a consulting company can describe its business as “123 Web Services, offering ERPAdda consulting for small businesses,” but cannot call its business “The ERPAdda Consulting Company.”

Similarly, it’s OK to use the ERPAdda logo as part of a page that describes your products or services, but it is not OK to use it as part of your company or product logo or branding itself. Under no circumstances is it permitted to use ERPAdda as part of a top-level domain name.

We do not allow the use of the trademark in advertising, including AdSense/AdWords.

Please note that it is not the goal of this policy to limit commercial activity around ERPAdda. We encourage ERPAdda-based businesses, and we would love to see hundreds of them.

When in doubt about your use of the ERPAdda name or logo, please contact VMRaid Technologies for clarification.
